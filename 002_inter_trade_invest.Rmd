# Purpose

Describe the theories about international trade and examine data about its benefits, volume and  patterns in the context of the global economy

# Patterns of international trade

- The __Harmonized System (HS)__ is a standardized numerical method of classifying traded products that is internationally accepted and maintained by the __World Customs Organization (WCO)__

- The HS code consists of 6-digits that are the same independent of the country:

    + First 2 digits designate the __HS__ chapter
    + Second 2 digits designate the __HS__ heading
    + Third 2 digits designate the __HS__ subheading
    
- Example of __HS__ code: 090111 (Coffee, not roasted, not decaffeinated)

    + Chapter __09__: Cofee, tea, mate and spices
    + Heading __01__: Coffee, whether or not roasted or decaffeinated; coffee husks and skins; coffee substitutes containing coffee in any proportion
    + Subheading __11__: Coffee, not roasted, not decaffeinated

# Benefits of international trade

- International trade

    + Increases the total availability of products in an economy [@vallejo_propuesta_2004] [@vallejo_tlc_2006]

        + The number of varieties of products for consumers increases
    
        + The number of varieties of inputs and capital goods for producers increases 
    
    + Makes the markets more contestable [@vallejo_propuesta_2004] [@vallejo_tlc_2006]

        + Monopoly and ologopoly markets tend to be more competitive reducing prices and increasing the consumption of products in those market structures
        
# Theories of international trade

- __Mercantilism__ [@magnusson_political_2018]
- __Absolute and comparative advantage__ [@smith_wealth_2012] & [@ricardo_principles_2004]
- __The Heckscher-Ohlin__ (factor proportions) model [@heckscher_heckscher-ohlin_1991]
- __New trade theory__ [@helpman_chapter_1984], [@krugman_chapter_1995] & [@brander_chapter_1995]
- __National competitive advantage__ [@porter_competitive_1998]

# Theories of international trade

- An outline of theories of international trade

    + An alternative view of __Mercantilism__
    
        + Mercantilism was  never a well- structured doctrine built on a number of well- settled  principles [@magnusson_political_2018]
        
        + Nowadays it is erroneously related with a policy that recommends a favourable  balance  of  trade (exports > imports) and a regime characterized by direct state intervention in order to protect domestic merchants and manufacturers [@magnusson_political_2018]
        
# Theories of international trade

- __Absolute advantage__: the ability of a party (individual, company, country) to produce a product more efficiently than any other party
    
    + A party should concentrate in producing a good in which it has an absolute advantage
        
    + ¿What happend when you don't have an absolute advantage?
    
- __Comparative advantage__: the ability of a party (individual, company, country) to produce a product at a lower relative opportunity cost
    
    + Under certain conditions, even if a party doesn't have an __absolute advantage__, trade with other agent can be benefical for both of them
        
# Theories of international trade

- Example of gains of trade using the concept of __comparative advantage__ [@ridley_when_2010]
    
    + __Agent 1__ produce 1 spear in 4 hours and 1 axe in 3 hours. 
    
        + To produce both products __agent 1__ will need to allocate 7 hours 
        
    + __Agent 2__ produce 1 spear in 1 hour and 1 axe in 2 hours. 
    
        + __Agent 2__ has the absolute advantage in the prodution of spears and axes. 
        + To produce both products __agent 2__ will need to allocate 3 hours 
            
    + ¿It will be benefical for agent 1 and 2 to trade? Yes!!! __Agent 1__ can produce 2 axes in 6 hours and __agent 2__ 2 spears in 2 hours. Then they can trade 1 spear for 1 axe.
        
        + __Agent 1__ has now 1 spear and 1 axe only working 6 hours. 
        + Furthermore __agent 2__ has now 1 spear and 1 axe only working 2 hours. 
        + Each of them saves 1 hour of work in contrast with a situation in which they don't trade and produce themselves both products.
        
# Theories of international trade

- __The Heckscher-Ohlin__ (factor proportions) model
    
    + An economy exports products that are abundant and therefore cheaper in the economy and imports products that are short in supply in the economy and therefore expensive
        
- __New trade theory__
    
    + Includes the posibility of increasing returns to scale where an increase in a same amount of all inputs generates more than a proportional increase in production
        
    + Includes the possibility of strategic interactions between companies in the context of international trade and olygopoly markets
        
    + Points out the conditions in which a government can use subsides to benefit a domestic company using strategic trade policies
        
# Theories of international trade
    
- __National competitive advantage__: 
    
    + The objective is to explain why some countries are more competitive in some industries using the framework known as _Porter Diamond_ [@porter_competitive_1998]:
        
        + Factor conditions: skilled labor and infraestructure
        + Demand conditions: characteristics of the domestic market
        + Related and supporting industries: other companies that supply or distribute products related to the specific industry being examined
        + Firms strategy, structure and rivalry: market strcuture of the industry being examined
        
    + These determinants create the environment in which companies emerge and become more or less competitive in relation to other companies in other countries
