# Purpose

Introduce the students to the concept of globalization and explain how it affects markets, production, inequality, culture, sovereignty and the environment.

# International commercial transactions

# Key players in international business

- Entrepreneurs and small business

    + __Born global company__: 
    
        + Adopts a global perspective
        
        + Engages in international business from or near its date of inception
        
        + Tend to have an innovative culture
        
        + Knowledge is consider as the most strategically significant resource of the company
        
        + Tend to use electronic commerce, if possible, to connect with clients and reduce costs
        
# What is globalization?

- It is a process of integration and interdependence at different levels: economic, political, social, cultural, environmental, technological. 

- Relative to the modern era, it began in the early 20th century with the development of transportation, communication, and the rise of global trade. 

- However, with the First and Second World War this process stagnated and reemerged again in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union and the development and adoption of the information and communication technologies (ICT) around the world.

# What is globalization?

- Areas of business in which globalization has had greater positive impacts:

    + Markets
    
        + Reduction of marketing costs because of standarization
        
        + Creation of new opportunities when the local market is saturated
        
        + Reduction or mitigation of sales variation between seasons for products with international sales
        
        + Identification of niche markets where products offer by a company only need partial modifications to connect with the new client
        
        + Adoption of a social responsability policy because of the rise of the social media and the need to be more transparent with the stakeholders and the local environment where a company operates in other countries
        
# What is globalization?

- Areas of business in which globalization has had greater positive impacts:

    + Production
    
        + Reduction of overall productions costs by accessing low cost labor
        
        + Access to technical know-how from abroad
        
        + Access to inputs that are unavailable or costly in the domestic economy
        
# Forces driving globalization

- Falling barries to trade and investment

    + Background: 
    
      + 1947: General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
      
      + 1994: Revision of GATT
      
      + 1995: World Trade Organization (WTO)
      
    + WTO: intergovernmental organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations
    
        +  Operates a global system of trade rules
      
        + Acts as a forum for negotiating trade agreements
      
        + Settles trade disputes between its members
      
        + Supports the needs of developing countries
        
# Forces driving globalization

- Falling barries to trade and investment

    + Regional trade agreements (RTA)
    
        + Check out the __[RTA database](https://rtais.wto.org)__ notified to the GATT/WTO
        
        + For example exploring RTA related to Colombia through interactive visualization: __[RTA database](https://rtais.wto.org)__ > Select a country/territory > Colombia
        
        + If you want to explore RTA raw data: __[RTA database](https://rtais.wto.org)__ > Explore the data > Export all RTAs 

# Forces driving globalization

- Technological innovation

    + E-commerce: use of computer networks to trade products 
    
        + Information and communication technologies (ICT) that apply mainly for the case of services
        
        + Advancements in transportation technologies that apply for the case of goods
        
# Measuring globalization

- KOF Globalization Index

    + The KOF Globalization Index measures the following dimensions of globalization:
    
        + Economic
        
        + Social
        
        + Political

- Other indexes

    + A complete survey can be found in [@caselli_trying_2012, Chapter 3] using a state-based approach
    
        + A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization Index
        
        + CSGR Globalisation Index
        
        + Maastricht Globalisation Index (MGI)

# Debates about globalization

- Jobs and wages: Globalization erodes standard of livings and ruins ways of life?

    + Arguments against and in favor of globalization [@wild_international_2020, Chapter 1, Section 1.4]
    
- Income inequality: Globalization increase inequality within nations, between nations or around the world?

    + Inequality within nations
    + Inequality Between nations
    + Global inequality
    
      + The main debate in [@wild_international_2020, Chapter 1, Section 1.5] is about inequality. However, the authors mix the concepts of poverty and inequality several times, generating, _in my opinion_, confusion to the reader.
      
# Debates about globalization

- Culture, Sovereignty and the Environment: Globalization eradicates cultural differences, erodes national sovereignty or isn't beneficial for the environment?

    + Globalization and culture
    
    + Globalization and national sovereignty
    
    + Globalization and the environment
